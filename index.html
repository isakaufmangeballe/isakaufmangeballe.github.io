New York City for the most part has lowered the bar of punishment for public urination to a low-level civil offense in 2016, according to a report by ABC 7. According to the map above, the highest amount of incidents were reported in the 115th precinct, which includes neighborhoods like Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst, and North Corona.The average number of complaints per precinct was 17. The same precinct-area only has 12 restooms according to the  New York City public restoom map locator.

</p>
In 2025, a New York City bill passed by the New York City Council that would try to increase access for the public restrooms in a hope to create a city-wide bathroom network.

</p>
This law would require the Department of Parks and Recreation, Department of City Planning along with other city agencies to submit a report every four years, with the intention of increasing the number of public restrooms to 2,120. According to an analyzation, NYC Open data there are 975 public restrooms spread throughout the city.
